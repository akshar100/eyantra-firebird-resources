 AVR Studio Version 4.17, Build 666

 Date: 26th December 2010

 This experiment demonstrates robot velocity control using PWM.

 Concepts covered:  Use of timer to generate PWM for velocity control

 There are two components to the motion control:
 1. Direction control using pins PORTA0 to PORTA3
 2. Velocity control by PWM on pins PL3 and PL4 using OC5A and OC5B.

 
  
 Connection Details:  	L-1---->PA0;		L-2---->PA1;
   						R-1---->PA2;		R-2---->PA3;
   						PL3 (OC5A) ----> PWM left; 	PL4 (OC5B) ----> PWM right; 


 Note: 
 
 1. Make sure that in the configuration options following settings are 
 	done for proper operation of the code

 	Microcontroller: atmega2560
 	Frequency: 14745600
 	Optimization: -O0 (For more information read section: Selecting proper optimization 
 					options below figure 2.22 in the Software Manual)

 2. Auxiliary power can supply current up to 1 Ampere while Battery can supply current up to 
 	2 Ampere. When both motors of the robot changes direction suddenly without stopping, 
	it produces large current surge. When robot is powered by Auxiliary power which can supply
	only 1 Ampere of current, sudden direction change in both the motors will cause current 
	surge which can reset the microcontroller because of sudden fall in voltage. 
	It is a good practice to stop the motors for at least 0.5seconds before changing 
	the direction. This will also increase the useable time of the fully charged battery.
	the life of the motor.
