 AVR Studio Version 4.17, Build 666

 Date: 26th December 2010

 This experiment demonstrates use of timer overflow interrupt

 Concepts covered:  Use of timer overflow interrupt to do tasks in a periodic way

 In this example timer 0's overflow interrupt is used to turn on and off buzzer with the time period of 1 second
 
 Connections: Buzzer is connected to the PORTC 3 pin.

 Note: 
 
 1. Make sure that in the configuration options following settings are 
 	done for proper operation of the code

 	Microcontroller: atmega2560
 	Frequency: 14745600
 	Optimization: -O0 (For more information read section: Selecting proper optimization 
 					options below figure 2.22 in the Software Manual)


 2. TIMSK4 = 0x01; //timer4 overflow interrupt enable must be done in init devices. It should not be done in timer4_init()
