/********************************************************************************
 Platform: SPARK V
 Experiment: 9A_Serial_Communication_USB
 Written by: Vinod Desai, NEX Robotics Pvt. Ltd.
 Edited By: Sachitanand Malewar, NEX Robotics Pvt. Ltd.
 Last Modification: 22nd September 2010
 AVR Studio Version 4.17, Build 666

 Concepts covered: serial communication (Using USB to Serial communication) 

 This experiment demonstrates Robot control over serial port via onboard USB connector

 There are two components to the motion control:
 1. Direction control using pins PORTB0 to 	PORTB3
 2. Velocity control by PWM on pins PD4 and PD5.

 In this experiment for the simplicity PD4 and PD5 are kept at logic 1.
 
 Pins for PWM are kept at logic 1.
  
 Connection Details:   L-1---->PB0;		L-2---->PB1;
   					   R-1---->PB2;		R-2---->PB3;
   					   PD4 (OC1B) ----> Logic 1; 	PD5 (OC1A) ----> Logic 1; 

 Serial Communication: PORTD 0 --> RXD UART receive for RS232 serial communication
					   PORTD 1 --> TXD UART transmit for RS232 serial communication

 
 Make sure that J5 us set towards the front side of the robot 
 i.e. USB to Serial converter is connected to the serial port of the microcontroller.
 For more details on the jumper settings refer to the hardware manual.

 Use baud rate as 9600bps.
 
 To control robot use number pad of the keyboard which is located on the right hand
 side of the keyboard. Make sure that NUM lock is on.

 For more detail on hardware connection and code application refer to hardware and software manual.

 Note: 
 
 1. Make sure that in the configuration options following settings are 
 	done for proper operation of the code

 	Microcontroller: atmega16
 	Frequency: 7372800
 	Optimization: -O0 (For more information read section: Selecting proper optimization options 
					   below figure 4.22 in the hardware manual)
